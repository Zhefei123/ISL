An Introduction to Statistical Learning is a textbook by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Conceptual and applied exercises are provided at the end of each chapter covering supervised learning.

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises as Jupyter Notebooks written in Python using:

*Numpy
*Pandas
*Matplotlib
*Seaborn
*Patsy
*StatsModels
*Sklearn
